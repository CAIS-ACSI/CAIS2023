abstract: "Faculty evaluations are a routine part of academic life, and theoretically serve to ensure fair hiring, promotion, and reward practices. In the search for efficiency, many universities are placing increased emphasis on quantitative measures that are flawed and which incorporate a bias toward team science and multi-authored work. The long-term consequences for certain types of research and scholarship in LIS are discussed, and academic leadership in the field is asked to act."
