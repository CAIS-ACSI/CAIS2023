abstract: "This lightning talk compares the user experience of the online conceptual
encyclopedia Political Concepts: A Critical Lexicon with its print predecessor, Reinhart Koselleckâ€™s Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe. It will initiate discussion of best practices for evaluating user experience of knowledge organization systems across different mediums (online versus print) so the final product can make sound recommendations for adapting 20th c. knowledge organization systems in political theory to 21st c., open access research environments."
