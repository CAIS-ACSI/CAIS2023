abstract: "This paper reports on a US-funded research project that investigates the development of an assessment framework for digital content reuse by cultural heritage organizations. Specifically, it will provide a conceptual framework for a nuanced understanding of digital object/content use and reuse and will introduce a set of ethical guidelines for the assessment of digital object/content reuse in digital, archives, and repositories."
