abstract: "Many knowledge organization researchers and cultural heritage practitioners authors have illustrated the fallacies, inconsistencies, failures, mistakes, and incorrect information contained in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). However, LCSH and its associated apparatus continues to be the dominant knowledge organization system in academic libraries (and increasingly, archives). This panel brings together individuals involved in a pair of connected projects aimed at documenting the harm and/or inaccuracies caused by LCSH by engaging in “ethical outreach” to creators and authors; by developing alternative “radical” or “critical” practices; and by evaluating the results of those practices."
